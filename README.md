# Statistical-Methods-for-Decision-Making
Analyse and Explore Data and Reflect the Insights - SMDM Project


### **Project Overview**


**Date:** October 2023

This project involves analyzing data from two distinct contexts to provide actionable insights that will help businesses make data-driven decisions. The project focuses on using statistical methods and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover patterns and frame analytics problems.

### **Problem 1: Marketing Campaign Analysis for Austo Motor Company**

**Context:**
Austo Motor Company, a prominent car manufacturer specializing in SUV, Sedan, and Hatchback models, is concerned about the effectiveness of its current marketing campaign. In a recent board meeting, the company's leadership decided to bring in an analytics professional to improve the campaign's efficiency.

**Objective:**
As a Data Scientist, your goal is to analyze customer data to understand demand patterns, preferences, and customer segments. The insights will help enhance customer experience and improve the targeting and effectiveness of marketing strategies.

**Data Description:**
The dataset includes demographic information (age, gender, profession, marital status, education, etc.), financial indicators (salary, loans, partner's employment status, etc.), and product-related information (automobile type and price).

**Approach:**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct EDA to identify patterns, correlations, and trends in the data.
2. **Customer Segmentation:** Use demographic and financial data to segment customers and understand their preferences for different car models.
3. **Insight Generation:** Provide insights on customer demand to guide more targeted and effective marketing strategies.
4. **Recommendations:** Offer data-driven recommendations to optimize marketing campaigns and improve customer experience.

### **Problem 2: Credit Card Attrition Analysis for GODIGT Bank**

**Context:**
GODIGT Bank, a mid-sized private bank, faces a high rate of credit card attrition, which affects its profitability. The bank generates revenue primarily through interest, transaction fees, and financial advice, and it needs to ensure customers receive the right credit cards that match their spending patterns.

**Objective:**
Your task is to frame an analytics problem using the Go Digit dataset, focusing on identifying key variables that influence credit card usage, activity, and attrition. The goal is to help the bank design better credit card policies and improve customer retention.

**Data Description:**
The dataset includes customer profile information (customer ID, card type, issuer, high-net-worth category), account activity data (savings/current/credit card activity over different time frames), financial indicators (annual income, credit card limit), and product engagement data (number of products held, bank vintage, etc.).

**Approach:**
1. **Identify Key Variables:** Analyze the dataset to find critical variables that influence credit card usage and attrition.
2. **Churn Prediction Modeling:** Develop predictive models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to identify customers at risk of attrition.
3. **Segmentation Analysis:** Segment customers based on their credit card usage patterns, income levels, and engagement with bank products.
4. **Recommendations:** Provide recommendations for improving credit card offerings and policies to reduce attrition and enhance customer relationships.

### **Skills & Tools Covered:**
- **Python Programming:** For data manipulation, analysis, and model building.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** To summarize and interpret data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** To explore data patterns, relationships, and outliers.
- **Framing an Analytics Problem:** To define and structure business problems as data-driven analytics problems.

### **Expected Outcomes:**
1. **For Austo Motor Company:** Insights on customer preferences and demand patterns that help optimize marketing strategies and improve customer targeting.
2. **For GODIGT Bank:** Identification of factors affecting credit card attrition and actionable strategies to design better credit card offerings and reduce customer churn.

### **Conclusion:**
This project leverages statistical analysis, EDA, and predictive modeling to solve real-world business problems. The focus is on deriving insights from data that can help businesses in the automotive and banking sectors make better decisions and improve their customer-centric strategies.
